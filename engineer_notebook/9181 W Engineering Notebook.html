We talked about a few robot designs that might work for this years competition.</p><p>XXXXXXX</p><p>05/09/2019</p><p>X-Block</p><p>Short X-block where all students were introduced to our new coach, Mr. Singbeal. We talked about many different aspects of building a robot including what is required for a design notebook.</p><p>XXXXXXX</p><p>06/09/2019</p><p>In Class</p><p>Discussed how systems and subsystems function together and did a team building exercise where we formed a “machine” with our bodies to represent how systems and subsystems functioned together. We were tasked with each person on our team drawing and writing about a theoretical system on a robot. This activity eventually evolved into a rough idea of what each teams robot would look like.</p><p>XXXXXXX</p><p>10/09/2019</p><p>In Class</p><p>Parts order arrived so we used the time to carry the parts into the shop and create an inventory. Having the items in top allowed us to see what materials we would have and what new sensors we could use in this years activity.XXXXXXX</p><p>11/09/2019</p><p>X-Block</p><p>With the parts that had arrived the previous day we set up the field for this year, during this process we realized several things about the field that we did not notice in the video such as the sizes of towers scoring zones and how a robot would actually function on the field.XXXXXXX</p><p>12/09/2019</p><p>In Class</p><p>We were taught shop safety and we went through the process of teaching first year students about what each part was and how it could be used on a robot. We also discussed what needed to be done about the current organization status of the shop.</p><p>XXXXXXX</p><p>16/09/2019</p><p>In Class</p><p>We reviewed shop safety </p><p><strong>Competition Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>What the competition is:</strong> </p><p>	This year's competition is called “Tower Takeover” the objective is to score as many points as possible in a 2 minute period. This 2 minute period is broken up into 2 sections:  autonomous period and the driver control period. The autonomous period lasts for 15 seconds at the start of the match and during this time the robots may only be controlled by a program. If one team has a higher score after this period they are awarded 6 points before driver control begins. Driver control then lasts 1:45 before the game ends. Once the game ends the referee’s then tally up the score and the results are announced.</p><p><strong>The game objects for this seasons competition are as follows:</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>66 cubes (5.5” x 5.5” x 5.5”)</li></ul><ul><li>There are 3 colours of cube</li></ul><li>22 purple</li><li>22 orange</li><li>22 green</li><li>There are 7 towers in total</li><li>1 tall tower ()</li><li>6 shorter towers ()</li><ul><li>2 of which are team specific</li></ul></ul><p><strong>How this seasons game is played :  </strong></p><p>	This main objective of this years game is to place cubes in your zone and increase the value of those cubes by placing cubes of corresponding colour in towers. Each cube that is placed properly in your zone is worth 1 point on its own. Cubes placed in towers are worth 0 points inherently however each cube of corresponding colour in your zone is worth +1 point. For example, if I had 9 cubes (3 orange, 1 green, 5 purple) in my zone that would be worth only 9 points but if there were 2 purple cubes in towers each purple cube would now be worth 2 points increasing my score from 9 to 14. Because of the intricate game design, it will be imperative to monitor what colour of cubes are placed in the towers and it will be crucial to make sure you use your team-specific tower to its utmost efficiency.</p><p><strong>Initial speculation on different strategies and how they will affect gameplay:  </strong></p><p>	There are many strategies that become apparent once you get a basic understanding of the game and these ideas may change throughout the season and may end up being sub-par. </p><p>In this season the autonomous period will be very important because of the point bonus and the introduction of purple cubes. We initially thought that each team would pick a specific role for autonomous by having one member score cubes in towers and the other score cubes in the zone, however this may not end up being that practical being that we have 15 seconds in autonomous and it can be used to do a variety of things. </p><p>Our initial thought for driver control was that one robot would work on the towers (scoring and de-scoring) and the other would work on putting high stacks of cubes in the zones. After the season begun we realized that robots could be well designed to achieve both functions in a short amount of time and it is more practical to have each robot function in its own quadrant of the field.</p><p>During driver and autonomous skills strategies are very different from competition strategies. </p><p>	</p><p><strong>Design Thoughts And Process</strong></p><p><strong>Initial thoughts on design and required functions for a robot:  </strong></p><p><strong>	</strong>This years robots have to do 3 things:  score cubes in zones, score cubes in towers, and remove cubes from towers. There are multiple different systems on a robot that can be used in this competition to maximize the ability to stack cubes and place them in towers. First of all, you could use a modified double reverse 4-bar to pick up multiple cubes at a time and place them on other stacks, with this system it is possible to place cubes in towers efficiently and quickly. Second, you could use some precision system to pick up a bunch of cubes at a time and place them all at once in one zone, by picking up so many cubes at a time it is unlikely that this system will be able to place cubes in towers without the assistance of another part of the robot. Lastly, Claw Bot . In the case of the robot that picks up many cubes at a time an addition might need to be added for the robot to be able to score and de-score cubes in towers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Breakdown Of Different Designs</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Double Reverse 4-Bar (Hard Design Challenge)</strong></li></ul><ul><li><strong>Pros: </strong></li></ul><li><strong>Cons: </strong></li><li><strong>Claw Bot (Easy Design Challenge)</strong></li><li><strong>Pros:</strong></li><li>Easy to build</li><li>Power efficient</li><li>Fast movement (Potentially)</li></ul><li><strong>Cons:</strong></li><li>Lack of functions</li><li>Cannot stack multiple cubes at once</li><li>Might not be able to score high cup</li></ul><li><strong>Ramp Bot With Lift (Moderate + Design Challenge)</strong></li><li></li><li><strong>Ramp Bot Without Lift (Moderate Design Challenge)</strong></li><li><strong>Pros:</strong> </li><li>Able to score by stacking multiple cubes at once</li><li>Can be modified if need be to create a lift</li><li>Can be modified to be able to place cubes in cups</li><li><strong>Cons:</strong></li><li>Hard to score in all towers</li><li>Bulky</li></ul><li><strong>Tether Bot (Moderate Design Challenge)</strong></li><li><strong>Pros:</strong></li><li><strong>Cons:</strong></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Final Decision On Robot Design</strong></p><p><strong>Start Of Building</strong></p>
